A python program to fetch the pictures of a given subreddit
Modified from here: https://github.com/nobodyme/reddit-fetch
The grab pictures do not work as I intent so I modified it.
Now use the pushshift.io API instead of reddit-API
It grabs the pictures and puts them in a folder under the name of the supplied subreddit.
